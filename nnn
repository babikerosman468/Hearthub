4️⃣ Vercel will auto-redeploy

As soon as you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically redeploys with the updated files.

Wait a few seconds → refresh https://babsapp.vercel.app/ → you’ll see the correct files.

✅ Bonus:
If you want to double-check, give me your repo link and I’ll check the file tree live with you.

Want to do it now together? Just say “Yes, let’s fix it together!” and I’ll guide every command 🚀
