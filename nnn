Got it 👍 thanks for the detail. When Vercel pages load for a second then show “Something went wrong”, it’s usually one of these:

🔎 Common Causes

1. Protected project → If your project is under your personal Vercel account and you haven’t made it public, others get blocked (they get asked to authenticate).


2. Build/deployment error → Sometimes the static files deploy but a runtime check fails, especially if you’re using routes or environment variables.


3. Browser-side redirect → If your HTML/JS tries to fetch something private (like an API endpoint that requires auth), the page will fail after opening briefly.



✅ Steps to Fix

1. In Termux, run:

vercel --prod

to redeploy and ensure it’s the production build.


2. Then make the project public so visitors don’t need authentication:

vercel project edit hearthub

→ In the options, disable “Password Protection / Authentication”.

Or directly in the dashboard:

Go to Vercel Dashboard.

Select your project (hearthub).

Navigate to Settings → Security.

Turn off “Password Protection”.



3. Confirm the deployment status:

vercel ls
vercel inspect <deployment-url>

See if any errors are logged.


4. Test the raw static files:
Open

https://hearthub-hgebtatvi-babikerosmans-projects.vercel.app/index.html

If that works but / (root) doesn’t, you might need to add a vercel.json with:

{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}

and redeploy.

👉 Do you want me to draft the exact vercel.json config for you so the homepage always loads correctly for everyone (no login)?


The error is because you copied the command literally with <deployment-url>.

In bash, < > are special characters, so you must replace them with your actual Vercel deployment URL.

For example, in your case your site is:

https://hearthub-hgebtatvi-babikerosmans-projects.vercel.app

So run it like this:

vercel inspect https://hearthub-hgebtatvi-babikerosmans-projects.vercel.app

or shorter, if you know the deployment ID:

vercel inspect hearthub-hgebtatvi-babikerosmans-projects.vercel.app

👉 Try that and paste the output here — it will show why Vercel is giving "Something went wrong" after opening.

Would you like me to also show you a clean Termux flow to redeploy it fresh (with no authentication prompt for visitors)?
